# Weekend Project

To consolidate this week's knowledge, students should complete the following project:
1.  Create a GitHub repository for your project.
  -Done
2.  Add all group members as collaborators.
  -Done
3.  Create a README.md file with your project description.
  -Done
4.  Use the story-telling-app as a base repository or create a new application from scratch using NextJS.
  -Directions located below to create a new app with base files.
5.  Implement a table of characters that users can create for the story:
  -  Users should be able to add, edit, and delete characters; and
  -  Each new character should have a name, description, and personality.
6.  Customize the prompt to generate a story using user-created characters, if any.
7.  Implement a summary of each character's role in the story after the full text has been generated.
8.  Test different models for story generation and compare their outputs:
  -  Evaluate how well the models "remember" user-created characters;
  -  Experiment with different context window sizes across models to observe their impact on output; and
  -  Test models of varying sizes and observe how this influences the output.
    - Use models compatible with your device, focusing on the experiment rather than overall story quality.
