# Hello Fellow Members of Group 2

I will be creating separate directories for our Homework assignments and Project

You as collaborators will be able to upload your files to the respected directories and perhaps download other users program to peruse through

Enjoy!

- First homewok was to create a ChefGPT model. It is located in the directory aptly named as such
- Second homework was to create an AI Joke generator. Again, the directory is aptly named as such.
- Third program was to create a story telling app. Again, the dfirectory is apty named as such
- Fourth program was to merge a ts-playgound with the story-telling-app. So I aptly named the folder story-telling-playground.
