# Weekend Project

## To consolidate this week's learning, complete the following project:

    Create a GitHub repository for your project
    Add all group members as collaborators
    Create a README.md file with a comprehensive project description
    Use the ts-playground as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js
    Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads
        Users should upload a book or similar content with characters and settings
    Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file
    Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file
        Each character should have a name, description, and personality
    Add a text area below the button to display the results
    Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format
        (optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response
    Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI
