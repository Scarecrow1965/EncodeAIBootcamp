# Weekend Project

## To consolidate this week's learning, complete the following project:
1. Use the ts-playground as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js
2. Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads
    - Users should upload a book or similar content with characters and settings
3. Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file
4. Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file
    - Each character should have a name, description, and personality
5. Add a text area below the button to display the results
6. Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format
    - (optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response
7. Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app to enable users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories being generated by the AI
