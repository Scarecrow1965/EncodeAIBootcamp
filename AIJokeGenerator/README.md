# AI Joke Generator Homework #2

To consolidate the knowledge acquired this week, students should complete the following project:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project
2. Add all members of your group as collaborators
3. Create a README.md file with a description of your project
4. Create a new application from scratch using NextJS
5. Develop a page for generating jokes using AI
6. Add a feature for users to customize the Joke Parameters

   - Choose which parameters you'd like to offer your users
   - For example, allow users to select:
     - A topic from a list of options (work, people, animals, food, television, etc.)
     - A tone for the joke (witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc.)
     - The type of joke (pun, knock-knock, story, etc.)
     - The "temperature" (how much randomness/creativity to add to the joke)
   - Consider how you'll construct the prompt for the AI model to adhere to these parameters

7. After configuring the parameters, users should click a button to generate the joke, and the generated response must be displayed on the user's screen within the same page
8. Add a feature for the AI to evaluate if the generated jokes are "funny", "appropriate", "offensive", or other criteria you deem important
9. Experiment with different prompts and system instructions to optimize generalist AI models for "subjective" classification tasks like humor, appropriateness, offensiveness, etc.
